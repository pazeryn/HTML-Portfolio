    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>I enjoy anime a lot, and this is one I could watch endlessly.</p>

<h3>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</h3>
<p>This is hands down one of the best action movies ever made. I am cheering, shouting, crying... I feel like a kid again watching this movie.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings: Two Towers</h3>
<p>This movie has everything. Action, romance, fantasy, beautiful visuals, great acting, best characters, gorgeous music... I've loved it since the day I saw it. </p>
